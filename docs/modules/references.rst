The `quantum-robot` package belongs to a research project with the goal
of study Quantum-Like modeling for robotics applications. While the package
provide a high level abstraction, it is suggested to read the related research
(at least to skim it) in order to grasp the big picture behind it:

- `A Preliminary Study for a Quantum-like Robot Perception Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02771>`__.
- `Multi-sensory Integration in a Quantum-Like Robot Perception Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16404>`__.

.. note::
    A ROS package -- currently **under development** -- is linked to the research and provide
    simulations and tools for real-time testing on robotic hardware, and will be released soon.
